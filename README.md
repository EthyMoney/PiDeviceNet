# PiNet
I made this project to use Raspberry Pis to control various devices around my home. This includes relays, VRMs, LCDs, and various sensors. The idea here is to have a main Pi that handles the communication to several other Pis to relay commands and manage device control across the home. This is a work in progress and just something I'm playing with in my free time.
