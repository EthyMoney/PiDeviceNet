# PiDeviceNet


I made this project to use Raspberry Pis to control various devices around my home. This includes relays, VRMs, LCDs, and various sensors. The idea here is to have a main Pi that handles the communication to several other Pis to relay commands and manage device control across the home. This is a work in progress and just something I'm playing with in my free time.

As I continue working, I'm realizing that this could potentially be a useful tool for anyone to use as a drop-in solution for their own device control using multiple raspberry pies. I'll be making functionality generic and adaptable for anyone to make use of this as I move forward to help with this. I plan to release this project as package that anyone can add to their projects and get up and running really quickly and easily.

Raspberry Pi models supported:

* Raspberry Pi Models: Tested and confirmed support for Pi 1, 2, 4 (all memory sizes), Zero, Zero W. Models A and B and any of their revisions will work fine.

<br/>

Controllable devices currently supported:

* Relays
* i2c LCDs (16x2, 16x4, 20x2, 20x4 fully supported!)
* PWM voltage regulators
* Temperature and humidity sensors (DHT sesnors)
* Belkin Wemo device support

<br/>

Devices currently in developement/testing:

* Motion sensors
* Desktop GUI control program for Windows and Mac
* DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor

<br/>

More devices and features that are coming soon:

* IR transmitters and receivers
* Graphical user interface for Raspberry Pi
* More LCD sizes and interface types
* Button and switch input
* LED indication output
* Speakers (good for alarms or notification tones)
* Proximity sensors
* Voice recognition for commands
* OpenHab integration for phone control support using Siri and Google Assistant

<br/>
These features toward the bottom are further out, but I do plan to add them when I can. My goal is to make this a powerful, yet really easy to use solution that anyone with some raspverry pies can use! Any feedback or requests that you have are appreciated, so please feel free to reach out!
